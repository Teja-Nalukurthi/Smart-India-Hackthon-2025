# Profile Setup Implementation - COMPLETE

## ✅ Issue Fully Resolved

The database connectivity issue has been completely resolved. The UserProfile model now perfectly matches your Supabase database schema.

## 🎯 What Works Now

### Database Integration
- ✅ **PostGIS Support** - Handles `location_point` geometry field properly
- ✅ **Custom Enum** - Works with your `public.user_role` enum type
- ✅ **Proper Timestamps** - Handles timezone-aware timestamps correctly
- ✅ **Foreign Key** - Links to `auth.users` table via cascade delete

### Profile Setup Flow
- ✅ **Seamless Signup** - Users go directly from signup to profile setup
- ✅ **Role Selection** - Choose between Explorer (customer) and Artisan
- ✅ **Form Validation** - Proper validation for phone numbers and required fields
- ✅ **Optional Fields** - Phone and bio are optional, location is required
- ✅ **Skip Option** - Users can skip profile setup and create minimal profile

### Data Flow
1. User signs up → Account created in `auth.users`
2. ProfileSetupScreen opens automatically 
3. User fills profile info → Data saved to `user_profiles` table
4. Redirected to main app with complete profile
5. Profile displays correctly in profile tab
