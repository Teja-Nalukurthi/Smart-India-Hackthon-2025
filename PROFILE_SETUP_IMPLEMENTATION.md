# Profile Setup Implementation Summary

## What was implemented

A complete profile setup flow that redirects users after signup to collect additional information before entering the main app.

## Files Created/Modified

### 1. ProfileSetupScreen (`lib/features/auth/presentation/screens/profile_setup_screen.dart`)
- **Purpose**: Collects user information after successful signup
- **Features**:
  - User role selection (Explorer/Customer vs Artisan)
  - Phone number input (optional)
  - Location input (required)
  - Bio/description input (optional, changes placeholder based on role)
  - Form validation
  - "Complete Profile" button to save data
  - "Skip for now" button to create minimal profile

### 2. AuthProvider Updates (`lib/core/providers/auth_provider.dart`)
- **Added**: `createUserProfile()` method
- **Purpose**: Creates new user profiles in the database
- **Integration**: Works with SupabaseService to store profile data

### 3. SignupScreen Updates (`lib/features/auth/presentation/screens/signup_screen.dart`)
- **Modified**: Navigation after successful signup
- **Changed**: Redirects to ProfileSetupScreen instead of login screen
- **Data Flow**: Passes user ID, email, and full name to profile setup

## User Flow

1. User signs up with email, password, and full name
2. Account is created in Supabase Auth
3. User is redirected to ProfileSetupScreen (not login)
4. User completes profile information:
   - Selects role (Explorer or Artisan)
   - Enters location (required)
   - Optionally adds phone number and bio
5. Profile data is saved to `user_profiles` table in database
6. User is redirected to main app (`/main`)

## Database Integration

- Uses existing `user_profiles` table in Supabase
- Stores all UserProfile model fields:
  - Basic info: id, email, fullName, phoneNumber, location, bio
  - User type: role (customer/artisan)
  - Metadata: isVerified, createdAt, updatedAt
- Integrates with existing profile system (ProfileScreen, EditProfileScreen, etc.)

## Key Features

### Role-Based UI
- Different bio placeholder text based on selected role
- Explorer: "What interests you about local culture?"
- Artisan: "Describe your craft and experience..."

### Flexible Form
- Only location is required
- Phone number and bio are optional
- Form validation for proper phone number format
- Character limit on bio (200 characters)

### Skip Option
- Users can skip profile setup
- Creates minimal profile with just basic info
- Still redirects to main app

### Error Handling
- Loading states during profile creation
- Success/error messages via SnackBar
- Form validation feedback
- AuthProvider error integration

## Next Steps

The profile setup is now fully integrated with the existing profile system. Users will have a complete onboarding experience from signup → profile setup → main app, with all data properly stored and displayed in the profile tab.
