# ✅ User Details Flow - CLEAN IMPLEMENTATION

## 🎯 **What Has Been Done**

### **1. Streamlined Authentication Flow**
- **OLD**: Signup → Email Confirmation → Profile Setup → Main App
- **NEW**: Signup → User Details Screen → Thank You Animation → Main App

### **2. Single User Details Screen**
- Removed duplicate/complex implementations
- Clean, focused implementation with essential features:
  - **Personal Info**: Age (13-100), Gender selection
  - **Contact**: Phone number with validation
  - **Location**: GPS detection + manual entry with geocoding
  - **Role**: Explorer vs Artisan selection
  - **Bio**: Personalized based on role selection

### **3. Location Integration**
- **GPS Detection**: "Get Current Location" button
- **Address Geocoding**: Converts typed addresses to coordinates
- **Location Storage**: Saves lat/lng coordinates with address
- **No External APIs**: Uses built-in Flutter geocoding/geolocator

### **4. Thank You Animation**
- Uses existing `assets/animations/thankyou.json`
- Auto-navigates to main app after animation
- Professional welcome experience
