# Google Maps API Setup

The new user details flow includes location services with Google Places autocomplete. To fully enable this feature, you need to set up a Google Maps API key.

## Quick Setup

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create a new project or select an existing one
3. Enable the following APIs:
   - Places API
   - Geocoding API
4. Create an API key
5. Replace `"YOUR_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY"` in `user_details_screen.dart` with your actual API key

## Current Fallback Features

Even without the Google Maps API key, the app will work with these features:

✅ **Manual location entry** - Users can type their location manually
✅ **Current location detection** - Uses device GPS to get current location
✅ **Geocoding** - Converts addresses to coordinates and vice versa
✅ **Location validation** - Ensures location is entered before submission

## Files Modified for the New Flow

- `lib/core/widgets/auth_wrapper.dart` - Updated to bypass email confirmation
