# Email Confirmation Animation

Since we referenced `assets/animations/email_confirmation.json` but it doesn't exist, the code includes a fallback that shows a nice email icon in a circle.

If you want to add a Lottie animation:
1. Download an email/mail animation from LottieFiles.com
2. Save it as `assets/animations/email_confirmation.json`
3. The animation will automatically replace the fallback icon

For now, the fallback provides a clean email icon that works perfectly for the email confirmation screen.
